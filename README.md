CSCI 2270 -- Recitation 9 -- Final Project Phase 1
I will be the only person working in this project in from my recitation.
For this project, I would like to implement a k-ary tree to manage the inventory system of a bookstore.   This could also be done using a hash table, but I'm slightly less comfortable with this structure, I'd like some feedback as to which would be better for this project.  Each book is in a genre section at the bookstore (Fiction, Philosophy, Science, Religion, Travel, etc), and books that are in the same genre section would be siblings in the tree structure. The 'book' will be added to the tree as a struct with a value for the title, inventory number, and genre name, plus pointers to connect to other book nodes in the tree.  The first child->siblings will be implemented using a linked list and pointers; this way, memory allocation can be dynamic.  I was also toying with the idea of using vectors for the sibling structure.  The methods would include building the tree, traversing the tree to search for a title and printing which genre section it's in, purchasing a book (updating the inventory), deleting a book from inventory, adding a book to the inventory, printing all of the books in one genre section at the book store, deleting the entire tree, etc.  I haven't come up with all of the methods yet but I don;t think I'll have trouble coming up with ten.
